# Global Framework for Simultaneous Emulation Across the Nuclear Landscape
# BANANNE

This repository contains the code for the Bayesian Neural Network Emulator for Nuclear and Atomic Physics (BANANNE) project. The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch+Pyro library for the neural network implementation. The code is designed to train a Bayesian neural network to emulate the results of nuclear calculations many-body calculations.

## Installation
